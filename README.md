REMEMBER: You gotta install npm and bcrypt on your own personal machine to make sure everything works. You also have to set up your own local database (call it "barter") and then you can just put in the data saved in the UsersTemplate.json file into your local database and mess with the data that way.

Since heroku is under my account and everything, when we need to deal with pushing to heroku, I can do that.

FilesFromCourseOrganizer contains all my relevant files from Unit 11. I had to put them somewhere else because they try to access a different database than what we're going to be using for this project.
